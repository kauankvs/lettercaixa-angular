# Lettercaixa

This is the front-end part of a full-stack application using `asp.net core` (web api) and `angular`.

Lettercaixa is a web application for users to navigate throught a vast catalog of movies, selecting their favorite movies and writing and reading reviews.

This `angular` project consumes the lettercaixa asp.net core api for user log up and log in (with jtw), posting and fetching comments about movies and adding movies to favorite ones.
Also consumes the TMDB api, to receive movies and it's details.

~ This project is based on the concept of Letterboxd.
